## Reflection

* If you had more time, what would you like to incorporate into your website? How would it improve the userâ€™s experience? What challenges would you anticipate when trying to implement the feature?
  [ First, I would like to edit the map on my dark mode. Since I am using ReactJS and TypeScript on my code I couldn't find a way to change images between modes that I could fully understand. Further, I believe my website is not the best at responsiveness, so that would be a priority in fixing. Lastly, I would like to make the website more navigable for people exclusively using the keyboard to browse. ]
* Why do you think web accessibility is important, and why did you choose your specific features to include?
  [ Web accessibility is about including more people: respecting their right to also have access to things around them. When we code a website that includes as many people as possible we are in a way giving voice and serving them. The features I chose were mainly focusing on people with colorblidness and similar disabilities, so there is a heavy focus on contrast and color combination. Most of my components also have alternative captions, focusing on blind people. ]
